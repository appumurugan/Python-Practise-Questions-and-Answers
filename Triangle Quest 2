ou are given a positive integer N.
Your task is to print a palindromic triangle of size N.

For example, a palindromic triangle of size 5 is:

1
121
12321
1234321
123454321
You canâ€™t take more than two lines. The first line (a for-statement) is already written for you.
You have to complete the code using exactly one print statement.

Input Format:

A single line of input containing the integer N.

Constraints:

0 < N < 10
Output format

Print the palindromic triangle of size N as explained above.







for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1): 
     print((10 ** i - 1) ** 2 // 81)
