Problem Statement

Now, letâ€™s use our knowledge of sets and help Mickey.
Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.

Formula used:


Input Format :
The first line contains the integer, N, the total number of plants.

The second line contains the N space separated heights of the plants.

Constraints :
0 < N <= 100
Output Format :
Output the average height value on a single line.

Sample Input :
10
161 182 161 154 176 170 167 171 170 174
Sample Output :
169.375
Explanation :
Here, set ([154, 161, 167, 170, 171, 174, 176, 182]) is the set containing the distinct heights. Using the sum() and len() functions, we can compute the average.










def average(array):
    sum_array = sum(set(array))
    len_array = len(set(array))
    output = sum_array/len_array
    return output;

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = average(arr)
    print(result)
