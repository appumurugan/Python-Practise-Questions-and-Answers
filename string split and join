Problem Statement
In Python, a string can be split on a delimiter.

Example:

>>> a = "this is a string"
>>> a = a.split(" ") # a is converted to a list of strings. 
>>> print a
['this', 'is', 'a', 'string']
Joining a string is simple:

>>> a = "-".join(a)
>>> print a
this-is-a-string







print (“-”.join(input().split()))
