Problem Statements

Polar coordinates are an alternative way of representing Cartesian coordinates or Complex Numbers.

A complex number z

is completely determined by its real part x and imaginary part y.

Here, j is the imaginary unit.


A polar coordinate (r, q)

is completely determined by modulus r and phase angle q.

if we convert complex number z to its polar coordinate, we find:

r : Distance from z to origin, i.e., √(x²+y²)
q : Counter clockwise angle measured from the positive x-axis to the line segment that joins z to the origin.

Python’s cmath module provides access to the mathematical functions for complex numbers.

cmath.phase

This tool returns the phase of complex number z(also known as the argument of z).

>>> phase(complex(-1.0, 0.0))
3.1415926535897931
abs

This tool returns the modulus (absolute value) of complex number z.

>>> abs(complex(-1.0, 0.0))
1.0
Task :
You are given a complex z. Your task is to convert it to polar coordinates.

Input Format :
A single line containing the complex number z. Note: complex() function can be used in python to convert the input as a complex number.

Constraints :
Given number is a valid complex number






import cmath;

num = complex(input())
z = complex(num)

print(cmath.polar(z)[0])
print(cmath.polar(z)[1])
