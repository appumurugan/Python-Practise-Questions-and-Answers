Given the names and grades for each student in a class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.



xample


records  = [[ “chi”, 20.0]], [“beta”, 50.0], [“alpha”, 50.0]

The ordered list of scores is [20.0, 50.0], so the second lowest score is 50.0. There are two students with that score: [“beta”, “alpha”]. Ordered alphabetically, the names are printed as:







Result =[]
scorelist = []

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        name = input()
        score = float(input())
        Result+=[[name,score]]
        scorelist+=[score]
    b=sorted(list(set(scorelist)))[1] 

    for a,c in sorted(Result):
        if c==b:
            print(a)
