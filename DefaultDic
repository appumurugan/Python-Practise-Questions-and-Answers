The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a default value if that key has not been set yet. If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn't, set it to what you want.
For example:

from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(list)
d['python'].append("awesome")
d['something-else'].append("not relevant")
d['python'].append("language")
for i in d.items():
    print i
This prints:

('python', ['awesome', 'language'])
('something-else', ['not relevant'])








from collections import defaultdict

n, m = map(int,input().split())

a = defaultdict(list)
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[input()].append(i)

for i in range(1, m + 1):
    key = input()
    if len(a[key]) > 0:
        print(" ".join(str(c) for c in a[key]))
    else:
        print(-1)
