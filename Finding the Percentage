Problem statement

The provided code stub will read in a dictionary containing key/value pairs of name:[marks] for a list of students. Print the average of the marks array for the student name provided, showing 2 places after the decimal.

Example

marks key : value pairs are
‘alpha’ : [20, 30, 40]
‘beta’ : [30, 50, 70]
query_name : ‘beta’
The query_name is ‘beta’. beta’s average score is (30 + 50 + 70) / 3 = 50.0.






if __name__ == ‘__main__’:

n = int(input())

student_marks = {}

sonuc = 0

average = float()

for _ in range(n):

name, *line = input().split()

scores = list(map(float, line))

student_marks[name] = scores

query_name = input()

for i in student_marks[query_name]:

sonuc += i

average = sonuc / len(student_marks[query_name])

print(“%.2f” %average)
